It is a simple to do list program created by me (ADVAITH SARAVANAN). 

To-Do List Application
Description: The To-Do List application is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Written in Python, this text-based application allows users to:

Add New Tasks: Users can input new tasks to be added to their to-do list.

View Tasks: The application displays all the tasks, along with their completion status.

Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, updating their status in the list.

Exit the Application: Users can safely exit the application when they are done managing their tasks.

Features:

User-Friendly Menu: The application provides a straightforward menu to navigate different functionalities.

Task Management: Users can easily add, view, and update tasks.

Status Tracking: The application keeps track of whether tasks are completed or not.

Usage:

Run the application by executing the todo_list.py script in a Python environment.

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the application.

Add tasks as they come up, view the list to keep track, and mark tasks as completed once they are done.

Example Workflow:

Start the application.

Add a task: "Buy groceries."

View tasks to see the new task added to the list.

Mark the task as completed once groceries are bought.

Exit the application.
